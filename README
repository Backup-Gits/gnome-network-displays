This is an experimental GNOME Screencaster implementing Wi-Fi Display (aka Miracast).

Currently a test image will be streamed.

To use it, you will need:
 * openh264 or x264
 * NetworkManager P2P patches
   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/merge_requests/24

The changes are work in progress and need cleaning up. However, this should
already work with at least some Miracast devices.
